# Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website built using **Create React App (CRA)**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Create React App is now deprecated and no longer recommended for new projects.

## 📌 About

This project showcases my work, skills, and projects as a full-stack developer. It includes responsive design, clean structure, and modular components — feel free to use it as a base for your own portfolio.

## 🚀 Usage

You are free to download, clone, or fork this repository and customize it to build your own portfolio.

However, since **CRA is deprecated**, I recommend using modern alternatives like:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ⚡ (recommended)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-side rendering or routing needs

The project structure (components, layout, assets) can still be reused as-is.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React JS (via Create React App)
- CSS
- Responsive Design

## 📁 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
````

## ✨ Contributions / Forking

* If you're forking for learning or personal use, you’re absolutely welcome to!
